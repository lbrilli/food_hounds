<h1>Treat Hounds<h1>
<h3>Background</h3>
<p>Treat Hounds is conceptually similar to Chicken Invaders (the original 1997 version - so basically like Space Invaders). The object of the game is to use your treat cannon to shoot treats to all the dogs. When a dog catches your treat, it will disappear from the screen. When all dogs have disappeared, the level is complete. In terms of technology, this is built in javascript using vanilla dom.</p>

<h3>Functionality and MVPs</h3>
  
  In Treat Hounds, users will be able to:
  
  <ul>
    <li>Start and Pause game play</li>
    <li>View Directions for how to play</li>
    <li>Shoot treats from the treat cannon to dogs</li>
    <li>Move left and right to get to more dogs</li>

<h3>Technologies, Libraries, APIs</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Javascript will be the main language I write in.</li>
  <li>I will mostly lean on vanilla dom but may bring in some three.js or canvas.</li>
</ul>
  
<h3>Implementation Timeline</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Friday afternoon and weekend: </b> Set up project files and think through overall organizational structure of the game. If possible, start work on the game space. </li>
    <li><b>Monday: </b>Build out the main game space and get a static version of the game to render on the page. Begin work on overall movement mechanics and shooting mechanics.</li>
    <li><b>Tuesday: </b>Finalize the game including the movement mechanics and shooting mechanisms. Get the extra rules implemented such as lives.</li>
    <li><b>Wednesday: </b>Focus on styling the game itself and the overall game window for users. If possible, add some bonus features!</li>
    <li><b>Thursday morning: </b> Deploy to Github pages!</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Possible Bonus features</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>High scores board</li>
      <li>Increased difficulty levels through faster movement (dogs with zoomies)</li>
    </ul>
